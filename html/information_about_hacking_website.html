      <h3>How Hackers Gain Access to Information on Your Phone</h3>
      <p>If you have ever searched this topic online, you might find a multitude of blog posts and articles stating that this is true. In fact most of our research shows that this is mostly not true. If you thoroughly examine these pieces, you may find that the writer remarks that the hacker may need other software such as spyware and other devices. With these dangerous pieces of software installed into your device, a hacker can do a great number of dangerous things: seeing all the history and everything you do on your device; tracking your location; using your bank details for malicious things and many more.</p>

      <h3><br>Phone Security and Spyware</h3>
      <p>If you are in search for a simple and straight answer to whether hackers can hack your phone with only your phone number, the answer is <b style="font-size: 23px;">no</b>. Many articles may contradict this statement that I have made, however, it is important to understand that hackers can only perform dangerous things on your device if certain things are installed. There is a free app that a popular security firm called Certo has developed called <a href="https://www.certosoftware.com/iphone-spyware-detection/" target="_blank">Certo AntiSpy</a> that performs spyware tests on only apple devices. In addition to that, there is a separate app called <a href="https://www.certosoftware.com/android-spyware-detection/" target="_blank">Certo Mobile Security</a>that is only available on Android devices.</p>

        <h3>How Hackers Access Data With Your Phone Number<br></h3>
      </header>
      <div>
        <p><b>Links to Dangerous Websites.</b>This is very frequent with hackers as they send dangerous links that can steal personal data from you. It is not unusual for a hacker to do this as it is a very intellegent but malicious way to steal data from you.<br></p>
        <p><b>Phishing for Information.</b>Hackers often send fake texts or messages to trick you into giving them the personal information that they require to hack you. They will often ask you for your location or passwords to certain things.<br></p>
        <p><b>SMS Codes.</b>It is common that hackers send you an input box where you have to enter your SMS code. They will act like a company that you have ordered from and will gain this information from you. If spyware is installed, they will have full access to your account and the details.</p>

      <h3>Summary</h3>
      <p>In summary, it is important that I reiterate that hackers cannot hack your phone without certain information. This is very important to remember as it is important to not worry too much if you think a hacker has access to your phone number. Please remember to still keep safe on the internet and do not give away personal information to strangers that you do not know. Hacking is a common thing that people do; therefore, do not give private or sensitive information away.</p>
