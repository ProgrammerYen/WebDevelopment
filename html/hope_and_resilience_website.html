            Hope is an amazing gift that we have been given by God. During this pandemic, hope has given us many things; therefore, we must not forget about the good things that we have been given.  I must reiterate that lockdown and quarantine has given me many gifts of hope and joy.  God's grace is forever living and we must remember that he will always love us no matter what. No matter how dark the night is, no matter how dark your life is, hope will always exist and light will guide you back to the moon.

          <h3>How Hope Has Changed Me During Lockdown</h3>
        </header>
        <div>
          <p class="hope" id="Hope-Change">
            This pandemic has brought many new things to me and is a gift that we must enjoy. I have thoroughly enjoyed programming during this period and playing music, therefore, I must thank God for this blessing. Music has brought me joy at the darkest of times and was like a light at the end of an endless tunnel. Programming has tought me many things and has allowed me to explore the world of computers and technology. These are all examples of how this pandemic and lockdown has brought me joy and hope.

          <h3>What is resilience?</h3>

        <div class="resilience" id="intro-res">
          <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_resilience" target="_blank">Resilience is what gives people the strength</a> to cope with hardship and stress. It is the psychological strength that helps us cope with tough times and recover quickly from difficulties. During this global pandemic it is of monumental importance that we be resilient and win this war against the pandemic. Resilient people are able to handle adversities better than many others. Lockdown has significantly lowered people's health metally; therefore, it is important that we stay resilient and strong.</p>
          <p> </p> 
          <p>Dealing with change or loss is inevitable in life; however, it depends on how we deal and handle problems. Many deal with endure exreme stress, but now everyone is dealing with this pandemic and are experienceing stress. I must repeat and emphasize the fact that you must be resilient during these times. Have you ever wondered why some people stay calm during disasters and others do not? This is what separates resilient people from non-resilient people.</p>

          <h3>Why resilient people deal with misfortunes, stress and anxiety better</h3>
        </header>
        <div class="resilience" id="res-stat-peop">
          <p>Statistics show that aprroximately 74% of the United Kingdom population suffer from stress.This usually happens through financial problems, natural disasters, illnesses, death of a loved one or divorce. Resilient people do not deal with anxiety or grief by hiding or falling into despair; intsead the deal with these situations better than many others. What I have written does not imply that they experienec less grief or anxiety. It means that there cope with these situations better than many others.</p>          
        </div>
        <div>
          <p><h3>Summary</h3>Overall, it is important to know that resilience and hope will always be there wherever you are. Please be resilient and happy during this pandemic and lockdown as we all know that tough times don't last. I must restate that God will always protect you whatever the circumstance; therefore, always be happy as light will show you the way. Please be joyful during these difficult times as hope will always exist. Even at the darkest of times God's light will guide you back.</p>
